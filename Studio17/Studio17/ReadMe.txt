Q2 Test Cases  *note read helper is private-
 A vector that should work printed correctly - input {X X X  X 3} prints 
            X 
            X
         X     X returns success code 0
A vector with an O should be invalid and write will return a value of 1 indicating failure
A vector with an incorrect size char ex if there are 9 values and the end value is 2. This returns exit code 3 
Q3 An interface is really flexible and reusable. Also much more efficient, and client code is independent of the interfaces that we write.
Q4 We would edit createFile to check for an additional extension such as msc to indicate a music file and then use a music file class. This is not ideal, because it means that the SimpleFileSystem is directly dependent on knowing which types of files it works with, which is why we will end up changing this in the next studio.
